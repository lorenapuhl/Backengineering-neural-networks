# RNN Memory Dynamics â€“ System A  

This project implements and analyzes a recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to **simulate memory-like behavior** from temporal input signals. The model is trained to respond to signals of varying onset and duration and then evaluated for its performance and internal structure.

## Features  

- **Custom RNN architecture** (`Net1` from `utils.py`)  
- **Flexible parameters** for signal generation and network training  
- **Training mode** with multiple random seeds  
- **Analysis mode** for precision, weight correlation, and participation ratios  
- **Visualization** of performance metrics
