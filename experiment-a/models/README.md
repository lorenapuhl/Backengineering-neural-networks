# Trained Models

This directory contains trained RNN model weights.

## Model Format

Each model is saved as a `.pth` file containing:
- `epoch`: Final training epoch
- `state_dict`: Model parameters (G, I, w, h0)
- `optimizer`: Optimizer state for potential continuation of training

## File Naming

Models follow the naming convention: `sys_A{seed}_state.pth`

where `seed` is the random initialization seed (1-20).

## Storage Considerations

Due to file size limitations on GitHub:
- Only 1-2 representative models are stored in this repository
- Each model file is approximately 2-10 MB depending on hidden layer size
- Complete set of 20 models available upon request or can be regenerated by running training

## Reproducing All Models

To train all 20 models from scratch:

1. Set `train = 1` in `main.py`
2. Run: `python main.py`
3. Training will generate models with seeds 1-99 (modify loop to 1-20 for exact replication)
4. Each model takes approximately 10-30 minutes to train (depends on hardware)

## Loading a Model

```python
import torch
from utils import Net1

# Network parameters
net_pack = (tau, dt, input_size, output_size, hidden_size, g_G, seed, h0)
net = Net1(*net_pack)

# Load trained weights
state = torch.load("sys_A1_state.pth")
net.load_state_dict(state['state_dict'])
```

## Model Performance

Individual model performance varies based on random initialization. See `results/performance/` for comparative analysis across all 20 models.
