Understanding the firing-rate patterns of the brain poses a significant challenge. An increasingly popular approach involves simulating experimental observations using artificial recurrent neural networks, which are more convenient, and share significant characteristics with their biological counterparts. We train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on biological integration- and memory-tasks. By reverse-engineering our RNNs, we aim at understanding their dynamical solutions to propose feasible hypotheses for the working-mechanisms of their biological counterparts.
